# Vumble
_Easily enjoy the best videos on Reddit_

## History
Vumble started as a project that a few friends and I built back in 2016 as a replacement for Reddit TV. 

We posted it on [Reddit]((https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3savcn/we_revamped_reddittv_and_its_just_the_beginning/)) and it did well, but over time the code deprecated and we had trouble keeping it up. 

It's been down for a while and we've been missing it... 

## Now
So we decided to rebuild it in a more modern framework (*ReactJS*). 

It's still an very much an MVP, but building it has been fun and we really want to build something that people find useful. [Here's a list of some features we're evaluating](https://github.com/rtluu/vumble2/projects). If you have any feedback, we'd love to hear your thoughts - let us know wherever's easiest for you:
